# How to Test Ultralytics API Integration

## ✅ Your Implementation is Correct!

Your code matches the API documentation perfectly. Here's how to verify it's working:

## 🔍 Testing Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs

When you capture an image in your app, look for these logs:

```
🏆 CIVICHERO IGNITEX AI ANALYSIS - New 5-Class Model
🤖 Starting IgniteX AI Analysis...
📎 Firebase Image URL: [url]
🔗 IgniteX API Endpoint: https://predict.ultralytics.com
📥 IgniteX: Downloading image from Firebase Storage...
✅ IgniteX: Image downloaded: [bytes] bytes
🚀 IgniteX: Sending to NEW 5-class AI model...
📤 IgniteX: Sending request to NEW 5-class model...
📨 IgniteX API Response Status: 200
📊 IgniteX API Response Structure:
   - Has images: true
   - Images count: 1
   - First image has results: true
   - Results count: [number]
🔄 IgniteX: Processing NEW model AI response...
📊 IgniteX Raw response keys: images, metadata
📊 IgniteX: Found [X] detections from NEW model
🔍 IgniteX Detection: [class] ([confidence]%)
```

### 2. Expected Response Format

The API should return:
```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "results": [
        {
          "name": "pothole",  // or "garbage", "streetlight", etc.
          "confidence": 0.85,
          "class": 0,
          "box": {...}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. What Your Code Does

1. ✅ Downloads image from Firebase Storage
2. ✅ Creates multipart request with correct headers
3. ✅ Sends to `https://predict.ultralytics.com`
4. ✅ Includes API key in header
5. ✅ Sends model URL and parameters
6. ✅ Parses response correctly
7. ✅ Filters by 75% confidence threshold
8. ✅ Maps detected class to issue type

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If API returns 200 but no detections:
- Check if image quality is good
- Verify the image contains one of the 5 classes: drainage, garbage, pothole, streetlight, waterleak
- Check console logs for detection details

### If API returns error:
- Check API key is valid
- Verify model URL is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Look at error response body in logs

### If detections found but not recognized:
- Check if class name matches exactly (case-insensitive)
- Verify class is in the 5-class model
- Check confidence is above 0.25 (API threshold)

## 📊 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
- ✅ `📨 IgniteX API Response Status: 200`
- ✅ `📊 IgniteX: Found X detections`
- ✅ `🎯 IGNITEX AI HIGH CONFIDENCE DETECTION: [Issue Type] ([X]%)`
- ✅ Form auto-populates with detected issue and department

## 🎯 Your Implementation Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| API URL | ✅ Correct |
| API Key | ✅ Correct |
| Model URL | ✅ Correct |
| Request Format | ✅ Correct |
| Response Parsing | ✅ Correct |
| Error Handling | ✅ Enhanced |
| Logging | ✅ Enhanced |

**Everything looks good!** Your app should correctly call the API and recognize images. 🎉
