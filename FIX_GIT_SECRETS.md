# 🔒 Fix Git Secrets Issue

## Problem
GitHub push protection blocked your push because it detected secrets:
1. **Service Account Key** in `service-account-key.json`
2. **Twilio credentials** in `NOTIFICATION_SETUP.md`

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. ✅ Added `service-account-key.json` to `.gitignore`
2. ✅ Removed actual credentials from `NOTIFICATION_SETUP.md` (replaced with placeholders)
3. ✅ Removed service account key from git tracking

## Next Steps to Push

### Option 1: Amend the Last Commit (Recommended)

If the secrets are only in the last commit:

```bash
# Remove the service account key from the commit
git rm --cached service-account-key.json

# Amend the commit to remove secrets
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Force push (since we're rewriting history)
git push origin master --force
```

### Option 2: Create a New Commit

```bash
# Stage the fixed files
git add .gitignore NOTIFICATION_SETUP.md

# Remove service account key from tracking
git rm --cached service-account-key.json

# Commit the fixes
git commit -m "Remove secrets from repository"

# Push
git push origin master
```

### Option 3: If Secrets Are in Multiple Commits

You'll need to rewrite history:

```bash
# Use git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner
# This is more complex - only if secrets are in old commits
```

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

1. **Service Account Key is Already Exposed**
   - If you already pushed it, consider:
     - Rotating the service account key in Firebase Console
     - Generating a new key and updating your server

2. **Twilio Credentials**
   - Consider rotating your Twilio credentials if they were exposed
   - Go to Twilio Console → Account → API Keys

3. **Never Commit Secrets Again**
   - Always use `.env` file (already in `.gitignore`)
   - Use placeholders in documentation
   - Use environment variables in production

## Current Status

- ✅ `.gitignore` now includes `service-account-key.json`
- ✅ `NOTIFICATION_SETUP.md` has placeholder credentials
- ⚠️ Need to remove secrets from commit history

**After fixing, your push should succeed!**
