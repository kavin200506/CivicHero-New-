# 🔒 Remove Secrets from Previous Commit

## Current Situation
- ✅ Fixed `.gitignore` and `NOTIFICATION_SETUP.md` 
- ⚠️ Secrets still exist in commit `891b37f`
- ❌ GitHub will still block the push

## Solution: Remove Secrets from Commit History

### Step 1: Interactive Rebase

```bash
# Start interactive rebase for last 2 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

### Step 2: Edit the Commit

In the editor that opens:
1. Change `pick` to `edit` for commit `891b37f`
2. Save and close

### Step 3: Remove the Secret File

```bash
# Remove the service account key from this commit
git rm --cached service-account-key.json

# Amend the commit
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Continue the rebase
git rebase --continue
```

### Step 4: Force Push

```bash
# Force push (required when rewriting history)
git push origin master --force
```

## Alternative: Simpler Approach

If you want to avoid rebase, you can:

1. **Reset to before the problematic commit:**
   ```bash
   git log  # Find the commit before 891b37f
   git reset --soft <commit-hash-before-891b37f>
   ```

2. **Re-commit without secrets:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure service-account-key.json is not staged
   git reset HEAD service-account-key.json
   
   # Commit everything else
   git commit -m "Your original commit message"
   
   # Push
   git push origin master
   ```

## ⚠️ Security Recommendation

Since the secrets were already pushed (even if blocked), consider:

1. **Rotate Service Account Key:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
   - Generate a new key
   - Update your server with the new key

2. **Rotate Twilio Credentials:**
   - Go to Twilio Console → Account → API Keys
   - Create new credentials
   - Update your `.env` file

## After Fixing

Once you've removed secrets from the commit:
- ✅ Push will succeed
- ✅ Secrets won't be in git history
- ✅ Your `.gitignore` will prevent future accidents
